- title: An Enthusiastic Guy
  text: Enthusiastic, eager to learn, and always looking for a challenge. In my free
    time, I like to cook, meet with friends, and recently picked up the hobby of playing
    and collecting board games. I also enjoy music; whether that be listening to it,
    going to see it live, or playing it myself.
