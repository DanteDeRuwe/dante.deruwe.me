## About the project

FB Tweaker is a Chrome/Edge extension that provides you with multiple ways to make the Facebook website more pleasant.

With FB Tweaker you can hide sponsored messages, stories, rooms, and the right sidebar

### How to install

I'm planning to release this on the chrome webstore. For now, you can:

1. [download the project as a zip file](https://github.com/DanteDeRuwe/fb-tweaker/archive/master.zip "download FB Tweaker!")
2. enable developer mode in the extension settings of your browser
3. drag and drop the downloaded zip in the extensions list
