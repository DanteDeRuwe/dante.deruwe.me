## About the project

Lorem is an event management system for events organized by the IT Lab of Ghent University College. The events are added in a desktop application by teachers and staff, and students can register for these events in a web application. Staff can also manage attendances, as certain events reward the students with extra credits for their attendance.  
  
This project was built for the course "Projects and workshops II" of my education in Applied Information technology. It is for educational purposes only.
